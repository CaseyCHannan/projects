## Nrf24lo1

###Dec 10

got example working with Arduino from RF24 library.

Some approaches:

1.  Use RF24 libary with t44.  Uses USI.  Pins constrained.

2.  Follow website from Fab Academy [(torino):](http://archive.fabacademy.org/2016/fablabtorino/students/440/exercises/W15/net.html)
This gives a software SPI example.  I like the looks of it.

3.  Use this to complete Neil's library.

At least i think I understand enough to know which way to go on this.  It would be good to have
a simple nrf solution.s

###Jan 2019

Already started KICAD project to attach tiny44 to nrf24L01 in configuration that is compatible with RF24 libraries
but can also be used with software solutions.  In fabClass2018/nrf24l01/rf24_tiny44.

 - next step is to add a couple of pins to header, so I can use same header to program t44.
 - alternatively, connect rst and unused IRQ position with a wire!  I like this.
 - would be good to add button as well.  Could hack this in as well, I guess.
