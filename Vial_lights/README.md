# Injecting light into vials.  

Worked on Barbara's vials, installing a red LED in one.  Here are some notes:
 * Used Dad's tiny manipulating tools and his microscope.
 * Made soldering jig from Oomoo25. Great idea, but need stiffer material.  Probably sacrifice a cooking utensil!
 * Soldering easier than expected.  Used small tip.
 * inject with 1.2mm needle.
 * 100 Ohm resistor in series gives approx 30mA, the maximum specced current for this LED. (0402, Digikey 732-11991-1).
