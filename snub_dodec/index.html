## Vertex hubs for Snub Dodecahedron

My notes from Glenn's CAD file, imported into Fusion 360.

Pictures of milling setup and finished vertex prototype.  Milling was easy, once setup done.  Less easy to cut off
hubs at 13 degrees - need to make a custom cutoff tool. Then it should be easy.  The tubes I got for arms were oversized.
Better to get higher precision stock.


###Time?

  - Setup 1hr.
  - Drill 120 * 5 holes: 2 hr.  (machinist)
  - Cut off 120 hubs: 2 hr. (machinist)
  - Cut 120 * 5 arms: 2 hr. (machinist)
  - Glue 120 x 5 arms: 2 hr. (less-skilled)
  - Drill/slot or otherwise prepare arms for clamping: 2 hr (less-skilled)
  Total ~10 hours.

###Materials

  - Delrin 1.5"  $10 per foot.
  - Delrin tube OD 5/8" x ID 3/8"  $6 per foot
  - clamps $0.35 each.

###Simpler design?

Should be possible to use 1.5" delrin, with no "arms", then make 120 with ~6 hours labor.
And only ~6 feet of Delrin rod for material cost $600.

###Conclusions???

It would cost 5-10 dollars per vertex, even with my naive estimates.  Maybe talk to Shenzen?
