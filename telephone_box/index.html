Now look at motor board, work on program to get and send values.

analog in PB3
serial_pin_in PB0  interrupt on this pin.
serial_pin_out PB2

###Nov. 2, 2019

Modify 45.echo.interrupt.c

- disable interrupt in ISR byt clearing PCI0 bit.
- get char from serial in.
- set up PWM for PB1, OC0B
- set PWM duty cycle by equating OCR0B to char.

###Dec 2019

Work with gearmotors and pwm.  Problem encountered when gearmotors start up.  Motors draw enough current to pull down supply
force micro to restart.  Doesn't help to add caps.  Add 10 Ohm in series.  This works to  keep micro alive, but drops some voltage and
dissipates power.  Tried Jameco motor that works at higher voltage and has higher resistance.  Same issue.

Next, separate micro power supply from motor supply.  Thought I tried this without success.  Try again.

###Dec 4, 2019.

Separating motor supply helps.  Power with 0-12V benchtop supply.  Power logic from 5V FTDI module.
They still share ground on the board.  Use larger transistor to handle startup transients.  This seems to work reliably now.  If necessary,
isolate grounds and use choke in line with motor ground (if necessary)?
