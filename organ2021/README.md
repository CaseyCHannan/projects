## Virtual organ project(s) starting June 2021


Hauptwerk forum has good discussions on DIY and third party midi interfaces.

[midi controllers - this one for pedal and swell pots.](http://www.dtsmidisystems.com/midiencoders.html)

[keyboards, midi, other](https://us.midiworks.ca/)

### Possible plan

* Get Hauptwerk werking, and find combination of miDI keyboard and amp/speaker that will let us demo and try it at Church.
* Once manuals are working, in a combination that makes sound that is usable for Church:
  * commit to killing off the Rodgers 32B, 
  * Add a committed computer and a Church Hauptwerk subscription.
  * and MIDIfy the pedalboard for use with the two-manual MIDI keyboard.
  * Add a touchpad.  
  * Figure out how to interface to the existing speakers, using any amplifier necessary.
* Purchase new three-manual MIDI keyboard to insert into Rodgers console.
* Re-integrate pedalboard, and add support for expression pedals.
* Work on Audio, possible buying better sound card, amplifiers, speakers ........
