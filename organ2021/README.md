## Virtual organ project(s) starting June 2021

### Hauptwerk, suppliers, consultants, sources of information, etc.
Hauptwerk forum has good discussions on DIY and third party midi interfaces.

[midi controllers - this one for pedal and swell pots.](http://www.dtsmidisystems.com/midiencoders.html)

[keyboards, midi, other](https://us.midiworks.ca/)

[Sparkfun MIDI tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/midi-tutorial/all)

### Hauptwerk notes.
For ASUS computer, use ASIO driver.  Sound is bad until I click on "device control panel" and set to smallest - 2ms.  


### Thoughts on Rodgers 32B

* Very difficult to MIDIFY with existing organ kept intact.  No reason to do this other than sentiment/respect. **Agree! 
** I do think we want to leave console alone untilw we're very clear what the final product will look like and we have support of the all stakeholders
* Can reuse the console box, putting new keyboards in (with better touch).  Keyboards come with piston buttons that interface with Hauptwerk. **LATER ON
* Can reuse the pedalboard.  Use existing switches as MIDI inputs? **YES. I ALSO HAVE ADDITIONAL AGO PEDALBOARD
* A big project to reuse stop tabs - probably don't want to do this.  **AGREE!
* Current speaker system has r/l inputs to one speaker set and single input to Woofer.  2 X 500Watt Amplifiers in Organ "loft".


### Possible plan

* Get Hauptwerk werking, and find combination of MIDI keyboard and amp/speaker that will let us demo and try it at Church. **AGREE
* Once manuals are working, in a combination that makes sound that is usable for Church:
  * commit to killing off the Rodgers 32B, 
  * Add a committed computer and a Church Hauptwerk subscription. **IT SEEMS WE HAVE FUNDS FOR THIS
  * and MIDIfy the pedalboard for use with the two-manual MIDI keyboard.
  * Add a touchpad.  Novation Launchpad, or Behringer pad. **YES!
  * Figure out how to interface to the existing speakers, using any amplifier necessary.  Existing 2x500Watt amps should be good!
  * This all might be done by early Fall, in time for re-convening? Pedalboard may take longer. **WOULD REALLY LIKE BOTH IN PLACE FOR RECONVENING
* Purchase new three-manual MIDI keyboard to insert into Rodgers console. **THIS COULD COME LATER
* Re-integrate pedalboard, and add support for expression pedals.
* Work on Audio, possible buying better sound card, amplifiers, speakers ........
* A more expensive and perhaps favored alternative is to buy a console already designed for Hauptwerk and ready to roll. **IF MONEY WERE NO OBJECT
*  This might have integrated stop tabs and stuff.  The DIY scheme outlined above will leave us with many options for growth, and great flexibility to choos organs and play with sound.  A future organist might be overwhelmed by this, however.....Not Casey, of course. **I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE!



#### Early purchases:
* Computer
* Touchpad
* Pedal midi board.
* Hauptwerk subscription.


#### Later purchases:
* Keyboards   **I'm willing to spring for the cost of some midi controllers that can help us get up and running. I'd put this in the Early Purchase category
* Sound card
* Amplifiers, speakers.
