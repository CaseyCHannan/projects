# Programming the ATSAM and new ATTINY microcontrollers

We (i.e. Neil and his students) introduced two families of microcontroller starting in the Fall or 2019, and used them in Fab Academy in Spring 2020 and HTMAA Fall 2020.  Programming is now easier and cheaper in many ways, and the new microcontrollers are impressive.

"Mega"Tiny family:  
 - Describe and link to datasheets and pinouts and Arduino cores.
 - Program with UPDI, uses pyUPDI through an FTDI interface.
 - Program with Arduino.  Requires only a 328-based board.  All done through Arduino IDE, no FTDI needed.  Easiest.
 
 ATSAMs:
  - Describe and link to datasheets and pinouts and Arduino cores.
  - Bootloaders.
  - Programming with MAX32625PICO and pyOCD.
  
  Details - install this on Raspberry Pi?
