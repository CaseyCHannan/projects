###Atmel Studio

4/22/20  got successful project with tiny45. on Alienware computer Atmel 7.

Did not succeed in programming ATSAMD11 to blink an LED, although I managed to erase the existing bootloader.  Tried Neil's code from class webpage for blink, using both the infrastructure from the Atmel default project and neil's code bare.  The ICE communicates with the chip.  Looks like it should work.
