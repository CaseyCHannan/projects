##Notes on GENMITSU CNC machine.

**Assembly**

![picture of parts on bench]

* Hardware part count seems reasonably small - good job.
* Start 2PM
* Attach plate to four linear bearings and leadscrew nut.  Channel nuts can be made to go perpendicular with a little help from a screwdriver.

* Don't worry much about six channel nuts.  They seem to turn enough, and can't get to them anyway.
* When attaching lead screw, attach coupler to stepper, in a way that setscrews can be adjusted, then insert leadscrew.  Then assemble the rest, letting the leadscrew go through the bearing at its non-powered end.
* Completed and Ubiety 3:30 PM.  (Ubiety: the quality or state of being in a place: such as. a : the state of being placed in a definite local relation : position, location. b : the abstract quality of being in position). 
* Had to drill out control board acrylic holes to 5.2mm to clear 5mm screws.
