Received Ender3.

**Build notes.**

* Used documentation in booklet.  Took about 1.5 hours for assembly.  A build video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me8Qrwh907Q&feature=emb_title) that may be useful.  Suggests that tubing couplers be upgraded.
  * Note 1
  * Note 2, etc.
    
  * Printer bed was very floppy - several mm play.  Found that the roller bearing assemblies all have one side with a hex collar that is eccentric, and allows adjustment of tension.  Adjusted bed to get smooth motion with very little play.  Other bearing assemblies feel better, but may still need adjustment later. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liJ0DbuMeZ4).
  
* Tube connectors are not great.  So far, I cannto get them to hold the tube on the extruder motor end, although the het end one seems to work.    [Amazon link to replacement parts](https://amzn.to/2JXDcvX)
* Issues on getting hot end clogged and gap between tube and nozzle, related to poor quaility couplers. [Video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30qqKUwviww)
