## Dec. 2019

Stepper board:

  - lead broke at connector.  Beef up trace.
  - Need better connector design - can't use while bolted to motor.  See Jake's connectors.
  - Add capacitors near h-bridge.
  - Move four-pin header away from ISP header.

Successfully ran Neil's code, modified.
Next, program for single steps.  Then program for packets.
